            <p>In 2015, I was a volunteer for the Liberal part of Canada and my goal was
                 to contact people to give information on where they could vote and insert data into the database.</p>

        <p>In 2017, I started working as an order picker where I had to pick up the boxes that were 
            in the aisles in the warehouse and I was driving machines made for this kind of work like jiggers and load mounts.</p>

             made for this kind of work like jiggers and load mounts. This work was very similar to the work of Sobeys and it was even in the same warehouse.</p>
