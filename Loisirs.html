            <p>Video games have been something that I have been in my life for a very long time, and they have shaped my personality and made the man that I am today.

        <p>I like to go the gym and practice weightlifting! It is an activity that 
            allows me to take a break from the duties of everyday life and just enjoy some time for myself. I also started boxing which is very fun and promotes confidence</p>

        <p>I have become a Muslim around 3 years ago and it has been a religion that I have been
